## Application Functionality

The project was required to feature a number of items. We needed to use at least 2 API's , and one new technology. The goal was to create a functional application that we could demo to the class showing a polished and user friendly front end, and at least the basic level of functionality for what the primary goal of the app is supposed to represent.

## Tech Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* Google Firebase DB
* Font Awesome
* theMealsDB API
* DadJoke API
* Modal Style Popups
* Experimented with SASS

## Details of the Application

The Salty Beards recipe-app is currently useable to search for recipes online, and save your favorites to the database. Once save, you will be able to view your saved recipes at any time. The application currently calls the MealsDB API to search for existing recipes. We also include a call to a series of silly food related jokes on the main page on every change/reload to keep things amusing. There is also a modal pop up to allow for the user to enter in their own recipe info and save it to the database. 

## Desired Improvements for future versions

* Ability to show app database recipes first, then the API results.
* Ability to login and have specific recipe box for each user. 
* Addition of authentication and login for each user to allow for unique data being save to the DB for each user.
* More robust search results through a larger and more detailed API.
* Ability to add and search for recipes based on nutrition, type of cuisine, and time to prepare.
* Allow the user to upload a picture of the meal they have added to show on the card and expanded recipe.
* Ability to view details of the user saved recipes, just like the database searched ones.
* Expand and enhance the saved page to work more like a favorites section. Allow user to re-organize their favorite recipes.
